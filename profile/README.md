## AWFixers Stuff CTA:

(modified version of [this](https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver))

This Project is necessary since toxic elements within Linux-based projects, moles from BigTech, are boycotting any substantial work, in order to destroy the "projects", to eliminate competition of their own products. Classic "embrace, extend, extinguish" tactics.

This is an independent project, not at all affiliated with BigTech or any of their subsidiaries or tax evasion tools, nor any political activists groups, state actors, etc. It's explicitly free of any "DEI" or similar discriminatory policies. Anybody who's treating others nicely is welcomed.

It doesn't matter which country you're coming from, your political views, your race, your sex, your age, your food menu, whether you wear boots or heels, whether you're furry or fairy, Conan or McKay, comic character, a small furry creature from Alpha Centauri, or just a boring average person. Anybody who's interested in bringing AWFixers Stuff forward is welcome.

Together we'll make FOSS great again!
