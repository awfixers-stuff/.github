hey gng

we have made the choice to begin migrating all of our code off of github an onto other git hosting providers. Currently we are migrating to a mirror setup between codeberg and gitlab, eventually we will migrate to a gitlab dedcated instance.

we apologize for any issues this may cause

effective immeidiately we will be archiving this organization and moving all repos that must remain on github to the awfixer user account

you can find our [gitlab] and [codeberg] orgs will be where you can open PRs, issues and have discussions

as always you are free to join our [Discord]
