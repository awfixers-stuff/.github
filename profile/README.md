# AWFixer's Stuff

**One quality open-source project at a time.**

this org has a selection of public projects and a larger selection of private projects. I will open source some of them as time goes on. Right now they are being used in a way that makes keeping them private the way to go.

since this is my personal org, you can join my friend group discord server via the button above. We talk, donars get benefits and we have pretty lax rules. If you use these projects in production or have questions about AWFixer and Friends stuff, you will need to visit the [AW&Friends] website and start there.

## AWFixer and Friends CTA:

This Project is necessary since toxic elements within OSS projects, moles from BigTech, are boycotting any substantial work, in order to destroy the "projects", to eliminate competition of their own products. Classic "embrace, extend, extinguish" tactics.

This is an independent project, not at all affiliated with BigTech or any of their subsidiaries or tax evasion tools, nor any political activists groups, state actors, etc. It's explicitly free of any "DEI" or similar discriminatory policies. Anybody who's treating others nicely is welcomed.

It doesn't matter which country you're coming from, your political views, your race, your sex, your age, your food menu, whether you wear boots or heels, whether you're furry or fairy, Conan or McKay, comic character, a small furry creature from Alpha Centauri, or just a boring average person. Anybody who's interested in bringing AWFixers Stuff forward is welcome.

Together we'll make FOSS great again!
