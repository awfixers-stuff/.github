**One quality open-source project at a time.**

## About Us

Welcome to AWFixer and Friends! We're a collective of developers, creators, and innovators who believe in the power of **community-driven software**. Our mission is simple but ambitious: to challenge the giants by building superior open-source alternatives. We're passionate about crafting elegant, powerful, and free tools that empower users and developers alike.

Why? Because we believe that the best software should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind paywalls or controlled by corporate interests. We're here to prove that a dedicated community can build better, more innovative solutions than any mega-corp. 🎯

## Our Philosophy

* **Quality Over Everything**: We prioritize robust, well-documented, and beautifully crafted code. We're not just building software; we're building tools that last.
* **The Power of Community**: Collaboration is our cornerstone. We believe that diverse perspectives lead to better products. Every contribution, big or small, is valued here.
* **Radical Transparency**: Our work is done in the open. From our roadmap to our code, we believe in being fully transparent with our community.
* **Disrupt and Empower**: We're not afraid to challenge the status quo. Our goal is to create open-source projects that are so good, they become the new standard.

## AWFixer and Friends CTA:

This Project is necessary since toxic elements within OSS projects, moles from BigTech, are boycotting any substantial work, in order to destroy the "projects", to eliminate competition of their own products. Classic "embrace, extend, extinguish" tactics.

This is an independent project, not at all affiliated with BigTech or any of their subsidiaries or tax evasion tools, nor any political activists groups, state actors, etc. It's explicitly free of any "DEI" or similar discriminatory policies. Anybody who's treating others nicely is welcomed.

It doesn't matter which country you're coming from, your political views, your race, your sex, your age, your food menu, whether you wear boots or heels, whether you're furry or fairy, Conan or McKay, comic character, a small furry creature from Alpha Centauri, or just a boring average person. Anybody who's interested in bringing AWFixers Stuff forward is welcome.

Together we'll make FOSS great again!
